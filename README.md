## New Rails Girls guide

Rails Girls Brussels team is working on a new Rails Girls guides, which does not start with a dive in Rails, but rather starts with an HTML page. Then we are slowly adding other concepts, slowly making the bridge to why we want to automate things and have Rails in place.

## Local setup

* clone the project to your machine: `git clone git@github.com:railsgirls-be/railsgirls_guide.git`
