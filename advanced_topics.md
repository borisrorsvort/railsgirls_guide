# Where to go from here? 

So you went through the basic tutorials, cool. You know what HTML, CSS and JS mean and you had your first experience with Ruby on Rails. That is awesome, congratulations! But no worries, there is a lot more to discover. 

There are a couple of directions you can choose now. Depending where your interest lies, with what you have seen so far. 

## 1. Pushing to github.com

Software is usually kept in version control systems, to be able to go back in history and deal with different versions of the same files efficiently. Git has become the default in the last 5 years and github.com one of the most popular sites for hosting open source projects. 

This guide will show you some basics of git and how to upload your code to github.com.

# Is there even more? 

Of course. If you're already done with the above, or didn't find anything you really liked, there are sheer endless possibilities to dive deeper into any of the subjects we already touch upon today. You can check the official [RailsGirls.com list of guides](http://guides.railsgirls.com) for inspiration.
